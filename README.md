Neural network simulation of variability in the bursting pattern of the pre-BÃ¶tzinger complex.

Requires NEURON simulation software (http://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). The model is associated with the paper:

Fietkiewicz C, Shafer GO, Platt EA, Wilson CG (2016) Variability in
respiratory rhythm generation: In vitro and in silico models
Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation
32:158-168

Creates a raster plot similar to Figure 2C in the paper.

USAGE NOTES: Use run.hoc to start simulation. To get more bursts,
increase the simulation time.
